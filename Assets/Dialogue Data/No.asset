  - I see. I'm afraid to inform you that you are trapped here, human. To escape this
    place, you must search for the keys and find the door to unlock it.
  - However, I must warn you that escaping won't be easy, as there are creatures
    lurking in this place.
  - Good luck, Human! May your quest be filled with success as you seek out the hidden
    treasure.
